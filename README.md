## The name GTST explained

The name GTST developed from the following steps:

-   The project is about game theory and has 'ProjectGameTheory' as a
    working title, so a name with 'Game Theory' in it would be nice
-   The project is about setting up a server, so a name with 'Server' in
    it would be nice
-   A short name would be nice, so 'GTS' was a possibility
-   GTST is also an abbreviation of [Goede Tijden, Slechte
    Tijden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goede_Tijden,_Slechte_Tijden)
    ('Good Times, Bad Times), which is a Dutch soap series. In soap
    series, people often struggle with non-contributors. Problem was:
    what would the 'T' mean?
-   Appending a noun with a 'T' is a certain Dutch slang, resulting in
    'Game Theory ServerT'
